# Summing sinewaves

This is a model of 2 sound generators (also called oscillators) and their relationship to the unit circle. The oscillators produce the blue and yellow waveforms.

You can use the sliders to your right, to control the number of oscillations pr. second (frequency) of the oscillators, and how large (amplitude) the waves should be.

The red wave represents the blue and yellow waves combined (added).

The circle is called 'the unit circle' which has a radius of 1 unit.

The animation show how the movement around the unit circle, is actually what creates the iconic 'look' of a simple sinewave, when the movement around the circle is spread out over time. The movement around the circle, is also called the circles 'phase', which can be measured in angles ( 0 - 360 degrees ) or in radians ( 0 - 2PI ). One full movement around the circle is known as the 'period' of the waveform.

Exciting patterns (and sounds) come from multiple sinewaves being combined, with different frequencies, phases and amplitudes. Look at the resulting red waveform, when changing the frequency and amplitude of the blue and yellow waves.
