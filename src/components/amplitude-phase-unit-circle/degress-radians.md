## Radians

A radian is the measure of the **central angle of a circle**, where the arc length is equal to the radius of the circle

The central angle is the angle from (0,0)

whent The arc length is the measure on the circumference. If a slice of the circumference is equal to the radius of the circle, then that is 1 radiant.

The angle in radiants = S (the arc length) / R (the radius)
